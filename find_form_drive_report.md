# What can I do when I have the Output Type and I need the form or the drive report?

### By using the tables.

When we want to print (for ex. a Billing document), we have the following output:

We can take the Message Type (in our case ZRD0) and Transmission Medium (in our case 1) then go to SE16N with table TNAPR.

After running the table, we can see all the information's that we need. From the drive report name to the used form.

Both objects are custom (report + smartform) so we can proceed with the change in the object we have the issue.
